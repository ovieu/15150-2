\begin{question}{Task 2.1} %% Put the question title here %%
  The pinned picture on the Piazza post is of a long-eared rabbit with
  what seems like deer antlers on the top of its head.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Task 2.2}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Jon and Yoni had a discussion about lecture content, which is
    permitted by the collaboration policy. Since their discussion was
    not about homework, the whiteboard policy doesn't need to be
    applied.
\item Jon and Michael took notes from their discussion about
    homework, but they discarded them after the end of their
    discussion. This is akin to a discussion at a whiteboard, where
    neither of them would have been able to take home the content
    written on the whiteboard, so this discussion is permitted by the
    course collaboration policy, provided they each wrote the homework
    four hours after the discussion and they cited each other in their
    respective writeups.
\item According to course policy, students are not allowed to search
    the internet, libraries, or other external sources for homework
    solutions, so Brandon's actions in looking up a functional
    programming textbook for help on homework are not permitted.
\item In this situation, even if Michael cited Brandon as a
    collaborator on his homework writeup, since their `collaboration'
    could not have taken place at a whiteboard (Michael just read
    Brandon's notes), both are in violation of course policy. Michael
    should not have read Brandon's work, and Brandon should have taken
    care to safeguard his work.
\item According to course policy, homeworks must not be derived in
    part or whole from work of others. By looking at the staff
    solution from a previous semester, Jon is deriving part of his
    work from the work of others, and so his actions are not permitted
    by course policy.

\begin{question}{Task 3.1}
In the expression \begin{verbatim}(intToString 7) ^
  (intToString 9)\end{verbatim}, the left hand side of the
expression \begin{verbatim}(intToString 7)\end{verbatim} evaluates to
the string `7', which has type string. The right hand side of the
expression \begin{verbatim}(intToString 9)\end{verbatim} evaluates to
the string `9', which also has type string. Since the left and right
hand sides of the expression match the input types of the infix
operator \begin{verbatim}^\end{verbatim}, the whole expression is
well-typed and has the type of the infix operator's return type,
string. More formally:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item \begin{verbatim}intToString : int -> string\end{verbatim}
  \item \begin{verbatim}7 : int\end{verbatim}
  \item \begin{verbatim}(intToString 7) : string\end{verbatim} by
  (APP)
  \item \begin{verbatim}9 : int\end{verbatim}
  \item \begin{verbatim}(intToString 9) : string\end{verbatim} by
  (APP)
  \item \begin{verbatim}^ : string * string -> string\end{verbatim}
  \item \begin{verbatim}(intToString 7) ^ (intToString 9) :
  string\end{verbatim} by (APP)
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Task 3.2}
  The expression \begin{verbatim}intToString 2.0\end{verbatim} is not
  well-typed because intToString is a function with
  type \begin{verbatim}int -> string\end{verbatim}, and 2.0 has
  type \begin{verbatim}real\end{verbatim}. The argument taken by
  intToString must have type \begin{verbatim}int\end{verbatim}, so
  since 2.0 does not have the right type, the expression is not
  well-typed.
\end{question}

\newpage

\begin{question}{Task 4.1}
Since the fucntions argument is an expression, we must perform
call-by-value evaluation before we substitute the argument into the
function definition. The expression \begin{verbatim}fact
  4\end{verbatim} evaluates to \begin{verbatim}24\end{verbatim}, so
  the whole expression steps to \begin{verbatim}intToString
  24\end{verbatim}. \begin{verbatim}intToString\end{verbatim} is a
  function of type \begin{verbatim}int -> string\end{verbatim}, so the
  expression will evaluate to the string \begin{verbatim}`24'\end{verbatim}.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Task 4.2}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item \begin{verbatim}fact 4\end{verbatim} $\implies$ 24
  \item \begin{verbatim}intToString (fact 4)\end{verbatim}
   $ \implies \begin{verbatim}intToString 24\end{verbatim}
  \item \begin{verbatim}intToString 24\end{verbatim}
  \implies \begin{verbatim}`24'\end{verbatim} 
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
